# Top 100 Whale Address Tracker

Welcome to the Bitcoin Balances Tracker! This web app showcases the top 100 richest Bitcoin addresses and their balances. It scrapes data from a public site and keeps you updated in real-time on any balance changes.


## Features

- Color-coded badges show balance changes (green for gains, red for losses).
- Fetches data from an external source using web scraping magic.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap for styling, and JavaScript for some dynamic flair.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for server-side awesomeness, Axios for HTTP requests, and Cheerio for web scraping wizardry.
